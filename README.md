# Recruitment task 
#### This is recruitment task form my internship, resolved according to specific guidelines:

" .. among other things, that task verifiers will pay attention to:
* code cleanliness and good object oriented programming practices
* the ability to use ready-made libraries, where it can significantly shorten and simplify the code
* unit and integration tests to verify that the code actually works correctly
* reasonable error handling - it is impossible to protect against everything, but leaving the "happy path" alone will not be appreciated ðŸ˜‰
* maximum flexibility when it comes to configuration - so that there is no need to recompile the solution for no reason
* whether the code and tests can be run not only from the IDE but also from the command line "
